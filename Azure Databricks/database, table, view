********************create a database********************
create database if not exists ${da.db_name}

********************change to a new database********************
use ${da.db_name}

********************create a manage table********************
create table weather_managed as
SELECT * 
FROM parquet.`${da.paths.working_dir}/weather`

********************create an external table********************
create table weather_external
LOCATION "${da.paths.working_dir}/lab/external"

********************examine table details********************
DESCRIBE EXTENDED weather_managed

********************table path********************
%python
spark.sql(f"DESCRIBE DETAIL {tableName}").select("location").first()[0]

********************list all the files in the path********************
%python

********************delete the database********************
drop database ${da.db_name} cascade

The main differences between managed and external tables. 
By default, the files associated with managed tables will be stored to this location on the root DBFS storage linked to the workspace, 
and will be deleted when a table is dropped.
Files for external tables will be persisted in the location provided at table creation, 
preventing users from inadvertently deleting underlying files. 
External tables can easily be migrated to other databases or renamed, but these operations with managed tables will require rewriting ALL underlying files.

********************Create a Database with a Specified Path********************
CREATE DATABASE ${da.db_name} LOCATION '${da.paths.working_dir}/${da.db_name}';
USE ${da.db_name};



********************view scope********************
The view is associated with the current database. This view will be available to any user that can access this database and will persist between sessions.
The temp view is not associated with any database. The temp view is ephemeral and is only accessible in the current SparkSession.
The global temp view does not appear in our catalog. Global temp views will always register to the global_temp database.
The global_temp database is ephemeral but tied to the lifetime of the cluster; 
however, it is only accessible by notebooks attached to the same cluster on which it was created.
