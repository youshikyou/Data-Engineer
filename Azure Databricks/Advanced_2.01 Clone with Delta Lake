DESCRIBE FORMATTED sensors_prod


*************** Create a backup of your dataset with deep clone
*************** Deep clone will copy all data and metadata files from your source table to a specified location, registering it with the declared table name.
%sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sensors_backup 
DEEP CLONE sensors_prod
LOCATION '${c.userhome}/backup/sensors'

*************** One of the useful features of deep cloning is the ability to set different table properties for file and log retention. 
*************** This allows production tables to have optimized performance while maintaining files for auditing and regulatory compliance.
%sql
ALTER TABLE sensors_backup
SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  delta.logRetentionDuration = '3650 days',
  delta.deletedFileRetentionDuration = '3650 days'
)


*************** Creating Development Datasets with Shallow Clone
*************** Whereas deep clone copies both data and metadata, shallow clone just copies the metadata and creates a pointer to the existing data files.
*************** Note that the cloned table will have read-only permissions on the source data files. 
*************** This makes it easy to create development datasets using a production dataset without fear of table corruption.
*************** Here, we'll also specify using version 2 of our source production table.
%sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sensors_dev
SHALLOW CLONE sensors_prod@v2
LOCATION '${c.userhome}/dev/sensors'
